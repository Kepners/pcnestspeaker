## True Stereo - Not Mono Like Browser Casting

### The Problem with Chrome/Spotify Casting
When you cast from Chrome, Spotify, or any Cast-enabled app to a speaker group, **the audio is downmixed to mono**. Google's default casting sends the same audio to all speakers - no left/right separation. Your stereo music becomes flat and lifeless.

### No Grouping or Pairing Required
With Google Home, you'd need to:
1. Open the Google Home app
2. Create a speaker group or stereo pair
3. Wait for it to configure
4. Hope it works consistently

**With PC Nest Speaker, just:**
1. Click a speaker → assign it **L**
2. Click another speaker → assign it **R**
3. Play your music

That's it. No groups. No pairs. No Google Home app. Pick any two speakers in your house and make them stereo instantly. Change your mind? Reassign them in one click. **Play music your way.**

### PC Nest Speaker Does It Right
We engineered true stereo streaming from the ground up:
- **Dedicated left and right channels** sent to separate speakers
- **Parallel speaker connection** ensures both channels start at exactly the same moment
- **No mono downmix** - your music stays stereo as the artist intended
- **Any two speakers** - mix and match, no permanent pairing needed

### Hours of Engineering for Perfect Stereo
This wasn't easy. Getting two wireless speakers to play in perfect sync with proper channel separation required solving timing problems that Google's own casting ignores. We spent countless hours ensuring your left speaker plays left and your right speaker plays right - simultaneously, every time.

### The Result
When you listen to music through PC Nest Speaker's stereo mode, you hear the full soundstage. Instruments pan left to right. Vocals sit in the center. It's how stereo is supposed to work.

## One-Click Audio Output Switching

### Windows Makes It Hard
To change your audio output device in Windows:
1. Click the sound icon in taskbar
2. Click the arrow to expand devices
3. Find your device in the list
4. Click to select it

**Four clicks** just to switch where your audio plays.

### PC Nest Speaker Makes It Easy
Your audio output devices are shown right in the app. **One click** to switch. See your current device at a glance. Change it instantly. No digging through Windows settings.
